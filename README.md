This mod is made by Darth_Feder. It is open source and avaliable to see on github: https://github.com/DarthFeder/DiscoveryCraft.

I have a YouTube channel where I will be posting updates and videos relating to my mod, as well as my usual stuff.
Check it out here: http://www.youtube.com/user/MinecraftTechz.

DC is currently in Pre-Alpha (I just started working on it). It is currently more a bunch of ideas curculating in my head than a functioning mod.
If you have any ideas, please feel free to message me. If you have something to fix or update, submit a pull request, and fix it! :D
I am frequently on IRC, on channels such as #direwolf20 and #minecraftforge, both on esper.net.

Thanks to Pahimar for his Let's Mod series! It really helped to make this mod possible.

WHAT IS DISCOVERYCRAFT?

DiscoveryCraft is a mod for Minecraft currently in the works. Its main function is to add more scientific discovery
to your minecraft world. This is broken down into four main sector of science:

- Astronomy

- Genetics & Heredity

- Chemistry

- Physics

(In the future, I may also add Biology and Technology)


Since things are still being worked out (by that I mean nothing good has been added yet), I cannot say what will actually happen with the mod. But, I can tell you some of the things that I am planning to add in the future:

- A science notebook to store all of your findings. The first and main item of DiscoveryCraft.

- A research method.

- Tiers of teloscopes for star-gazing.

- Tiers of microscopes for bacteria-gazing.

- The ability to break items/blocks into their chemical components.

- With these components (or elements), you can store them or create other blocks/items with them.

- A discovery bar that works similarly to the experiance bar, only you don't lose it to death. The more you discover, the better at discovery you will be. You will lose some if you do stupid things, like walking into cactus, blowing yourself up, jumping out of the world, destroying your science mechanisms, etc.
  
- Temporary gravity manipulators (you can guess what that does).

- A sonic screwdriver for your all-around tool (unlike the RedPower one, this one will actually function :D).

- The ability to add or change your own DNA. This could lead to strange powers, or consequences!

- Achievements, of course!

- An "internal science battle". There are two approaches to science - the calm, gentlemanly science, and the crazy, mad science! Which side will you choose?

- To go along witht he gentleman vs. mad scientist approach, a tracking system to see what side your science is leaning towards.

- A lightning atraction rod. Put it on top of your castle, and watch as a small lightning vortex hovers over it! Will look awesome for all your evil needs. Probably will require some fuel source, though.

- Different kinds of lasers! Mining lasers, defense lasers, laser fenses, laser turrets, laser etc.

- Explosives (enough said).

- Time travel! Some really complicated stuff involved, so it is a very end-game sort of deal. You can travel to the past, where there is lots of magic and not very much technology. In the future, theres lots of technology, but they shun magic. Don't try to mess with their time paths, or else the big blob of wibbely-wobbely, timey-wimey will come crashing down in a paradox!

- Model rockets for flight testing experiments.

These are just a few of the things to come in this mod! I will hopefully be able to work on it and add all these things soon!
