In a nutshell: You are allowed to see, download, use, and edit both my source code and the compiled mod, but you are NOT allowed to distribute my mod without my expressed permission.

This mod is made by Darth_Feder. It is available to see on Github: https://github.com/DarthFeder/DiscoveryCraft.

I have a YouTube channel where I will be posting updates and videos relating to my mod, as well as my usual stuff.
Check it out here: http://www.youtube.com/user/MinecraftTechz.

DC is currently in version pre1 (I just started working on it). Remember, it is not yet a fully-functioning mod, so things may be very broken!
If you have any ideas, please feel free to message me. If you have something to fix or update, submit a pull request, and fix it! :D
If you are a good artist (unlike me) and would like to help with wither my textures or my modelling, I am devoted to your help! Please contact me.
I am frequently on IRC, on channels such as #direwolf20 and #minecraftforge, both on esper.net.

Thanks to Pahimar for his Let's Mod series! It really helped to make this mod possible.

#WHAT IS DISCOVERYCRAFT?

DiscoveryCraft is a mod for Minecraft currently in the works. Its main function is to add more scientific discovery
to your Minecraft world. This is broken down into several main sectors of science:

- Astronomy

- Genetics & Heredity

- Chemistry

- Physics

- Archaeology

(In the future, I may also add Biology and Technology)

Things that are currently in the mod:

- Unknown ore generation (a bit buggy with bedrock, may change) and smelting into dust

- Finding locks in dungeons, craft into notebook

- Sonic Screwdriver (creative tool for now)

- Flint tools and knifes (very good starting items - perfect for the first night)

- A lot of things that don't yet do anything!

Things coming up soon:

- A special, upgradable crafting table!

- Modular machines!

- A vanilla hopper sorting machine

- Armor sets

- Liquid Bedrock

- Better textures

In the future:

- A science notebook GUI and implementation

- A research method.

- Unlocking unknown ore's potential

- A way of liquidizing bedrock to get to the ore underneath.

- Tiers of telescopes for star-gazing.

- Tiers of microscopes for bacteria-gazing.

- The ability to break items/blocks into their chemical components.

- With these components (or elements), you can store them or create other blocks/items with them.

- A discovery bar that works similarly to the experience bar, only you don't lose it to death. The more you discover, the better at discovery you will be. You will lose some if you do stupid things, like walking into cactus, blowing yourself up, jumping out of the world, destroying your science mechanisms, etc.
  
- Temporary gravity manipulators (you can guess what that does).

- Lot's of types of tools.

- The ability to add or change your own DNA. This could lead to either strange powers or consequences!

- Achievements, of course!

- An "internal science battle". There are two approaches to science - the calm, gentlemanly science, and the crazy, mad science! Which side will you choose?

- To go along with the gentleman vs. mad scientist approach, a tracking system to see what side your science is leaning towards.

- Two different armour sets: a gentleman one with a top hat, monocle, and a cloak; and a mad scientist one with a lab coat and goggles.

- A lightning attraction rod. Put it on top of your castle, and watch as a small lightning vortex hovers over it! Will look awesome for all your evil needs. Probably will require some fuel source, though.

- Different kinds of lasers! Mining lasers, defence lasers, laser fences, laser turrets, laser etc.

- Control blocks with your mi-y-in-y-ind!

- Robot minions.

- Explosives (enough said).

- Time travel! Some really complicated stuff involved, so it is a very end-game sort of deal. You can travel to the past, where there is lots of magic and not very much technology. In the future, theres lots of technology, but they shun magic. Don't try to mess with their time paths, or else the big blob of wibbely-wobbely, timey-wimey will come crashing down in a paradox!

- Close-proximity time travel, going back to different points in your world's history.

- Model rockets for flight testing experiments.

- Lot's of references to random movies and such!! (If you've ever seen anything else I've programmed, you know it's not made by Darth unless it has some.)

- Many other things that the community is interested in having, for science!

- Oh yeah... and SCIENCE!!!

These are just a few of the things to come in this mod! I will hopefully be able to work on it and add all these things soon!
