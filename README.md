DC is currently in Extreme Alpha (I just started working on it). It is currently more a bunch of ideas curculating in my head than a functioning mod.

WHAT IS DISCOVERYCRAFT?

DiscoveryCraft is a mod for Minecraft currently in the works. Its main function is to add more scientific discovery
to your minecraft world. This is broken down into four main sector of science:

- Astronomy

- Genetics & Heridity

- Chemistry

- Physics

Since things are still being worked out (by that I mean nothing good has been added yet), I cannot say what
will actually happen with the mod. But, I can tell you what I am planning to add:

- A science notebook to store all of your findings. The first and main item of DiscoveryCraft.

- Tiers of teloscopes for star-gazing.

- Tiers of microscopes for bacteria-gazing.

- The ability to break items/blocks into their chemical components.

- With these components (or elements), you can store them or create other blocks/items with them.

- A discovery bar that works similarly to the experiance bar, only you don't lose it to death. The more you discover, the better at discovery you will be. You will lose some if you do stupid things, like walking into cactus, blowing yourself up, jumping out of the world, destroying your science mechanisms, etc.
  
- Temporary gravity manipulators (you can guess what that does).

- A sonic screwdriver for your all-around tool (unlike the RedPower one, this one will actually function :D).

- The ability to add or change your own DNA. This could lead to strange powers, or consequences!

- Achievements, of course!

- An "internal science battle". There are two approaches to science - the calm, gentlemanly science, and the crazy, mad science! WHich side will you choose?

- To go along witht he gentleman vs. mad scientist approach, a tracking system to see what side your science is leaning towards.

- A lightning atraction rod. Put it on top of your castle, and watch as a small lightning vortex hovers over it! Will look awesome for all your evil needs. Probably will require some sort of fuel, though.


These are just a few of the things to come in this mod! Will hopefully be able to work on it and add all these things soon!
